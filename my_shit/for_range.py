# For Loop and Range Exercise
# Use a for loop to add up every odd number from 10 to 20 (inclusive) and store the result in the variable x .  

# You could cheat and just figure this out using a calculator, but...that would defeat the whole point of this course.

# Can I put emoji in here? Let's see...🤗 It works!!!

# Add up all odd numbers between 10 and 20
# Store the result in x:
x = 0
for i in range(10, 21):
    if i %2 != 0:
        x += i
        print(x)
